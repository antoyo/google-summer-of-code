# Google Summer of Code
The Rust Project has decided to join the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program for the first time in 2024. You can find the accepted GSoC 2024 projects [here](2024.md).

The accepted GSoC Rust 2024 projects have also been announced on our [blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/01/gsoc-2024-selected-projects.html).

Here you can also find a [proposal guide](proposal-guide.md) here that should help you prepare your GSoC proposals for the next year of GSoC.

**Please do not harrass and/or spam Rust Project members and mentors, or other members of the Rust community! If you do so, we will not consider your proposal. It is fine to send a direct message (DM) to a mentor that you want to communicate with, but do not spam multiple people with DMs, asking them to be a mentor for your project proposal! Post a topic in some Zulip stream instead.**

The Rust Project can provide remote access to powerful cloud-based [Linux machines](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/docs/dev-desktop.html) to contributors that will be accepted for a GSoC Rust project. This can help overcome potential contribution barriers caused e.g. by an unsupported operating system or not performant enough hardware.
