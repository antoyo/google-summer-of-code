# Rust Google Summer of Code 2024 project ideas
The Rust project has decided to join [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) for the
first time in 2024! This page contains project ideas that could benefit Rust maintainers and the whole Rust community.

We invite contributors that would like to participate in GSoC to examine the project list and use it as an inspiration
for your project proposals. **You can also propose a project that is not included in this list**, for example
an improvement of some Rust crate. However, please note that ultimately, each project needs at least one mentor. We have
tried to make sure that all the ideas listed here would have a mentor available, but if you propose a different project,
you might have to find someone who would be willing to mentor you.

You can find some tips for applying for a Rust GSoC project [here](proposal-guide.md).

If you would like to discuss projects ideas or anything related to the Rust Project's involvement in GSoC 2024, you can
do so on the [`#gsoc`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/421156-gsoc) Zulip stream.

As a reminder, the individual project sizes have the following expected amounts of hours:
- Small: 90 hours
- Medium: 175 hours
- Large: 350 hours

# Project ideas
The list of ideas is divided into several categories.

## Rust Compiler

### Fast(er) register allocator for Cranelift

**Description**

The Rust compiler uses various codegen backends to generate executable code (LLVM, GCC, Cranelift).
The Cranelift backend should provide very quick compile times, however its performance is currently
relatively bottlenecked by its register allocator.

The goal of this project is to implement a new register allocator for Cranelift, that would be tuned for very
quick compilation times (rather than optimal runtime performance of the compiled program). A first attempt could
simply create an allocator that spills all registers to stack, and a possible follow-up could be a linear scan allocator.
It would be useful to compare the compilation vs runtime performance trade-offs of various register allocation approaches.

**Expected result**

It will be possible to use a new register allocator in Cranelift that will work at least for simple programs and that
will improve Rust compilation times.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Basic knowledge of assembly. Familiarity with compiler technologies is a bonus.

**Project size**

Medium or large.

**Difficulty**

### C codegen backend for `rustc`

**Description**

`rustc` currently has three in-tree codegen backends: LLVM (the default), Cranelift, and GCC.
These live at <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler>, as `rustc_codegen_*` crates.

The goal of this project is to add a new experimental `rustc_codegen_c` backend that could turn Rust's internal
representations into `C` code (i.e. transpile) and optionally invoke a `C` compiler to build it. This will allow Rust
to use benefits of existing `C` compilers (better platform support, optimizations) in situations where the existing backends
cannot be used.

**Expected result**

The minimum viable product is to turn `rustc` data structures that represent a Rust program into `C` code, and write the
output to the location specified by `--out-dir`. This involves figuring out how to produce buildable `C` code from the
inputs provided by `rustc_codegen_ssa::traits::CodegenBackend`.

A second step is to have `rustc` invoke a `C` compiler on these produced files. This should be designed in a pluggable way,
such that any `C` compiler can be dropped in.

**Desirable skills**

Knowledge of Rust and `C`, basic familiarity with compiler functionality.

**Project size**

Large.

**Difficulty**

Hard.

### Extend `annotate-snippets` with features required by rustc

**Description**

`rustc` currently has incomplete support for using [`annotate-snippets`](https://github.com/rust-lang/annotate-snippets-rs/)
to emit errors, but it doesn't support all the features that `rustc`'s built-in diagnostic rendering does. The goal
of this project is to execute the `rustc` test suite using `annotate-snippets`, identify missing features or bugs,
fix those, and repeat until at feature-parity.

**Expected result**

More of the `rustc` test suite passes with `annotate-snippets`.

**Desirable skills**

Knowledge of Rust.

## Infrastructure

### Add support for multiple collectors to the Rust benchmark suite

**Description**

Rust has an extensive [benchmark suite](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf) that measures the performance of the Rust compiler and Rust programs and
visualizes the results in an interactive web application. Currently, the benchmarks are gathered on a single physical
machine, however we are hitting the limits of how many benchmark runs we can perform per day on a single machine,
which in turn limits the benchmark configurations that we can execute after each commit.

The goal of this project is to add support for splitting benchmark execution across multiple machines. This will
require a refactoring of the existing suite and potentially also database schema modifications and implementation of new
features.

**Expected result**

It will be possible to parallelize the execution of the benchmark suite across multiple machines.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust and database technologies (SQL).

**Project size**

Medium or large.

**Difficulty**

Medium.

### Improve Rust benchmark suite analysis & frontend

**Description**

Rust has an extensive [benchmark suite](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf) that measures the performance of the Rust compiler and Rust programs and
visualizes the results in an interactive web application. It received a lot of new features in the past few years, however
some of them are not as polished as they could be.

The goal of this project is to improve both the frontend website and its various dashboards, and also profiling and analysis
tools used to examine benchmarks in the suite. As an example, improvements could be made in the following areas:
- Runtime benchmarks. The suite recently got support for runtime benchmarks that measure the performance of Rust programs
compiled by a specific version of `rustc` (the Rust compiler). There is a lot of features that could be added to get
runtime benchmarks to the same support level as compile-time benchmarks, like adding and visualizing benchmark variance
analysis for them or adding runtime benchmark results to various dashboards in the frontend.
- Analysis of multithreaded performance. The Rust compiler has recently gained support for using multiple threads for its
frontend, but there is no configuration in the suite to parametrize how many threads will be used, nor any analysis of
how well are threads utilized. It would be nice to add analysis and visualisation for this.
- Some pages of the website still use HTML templates. It would be great to port these to the Vue-based frontend.

**Expected result**

New analyses will be available in the Rust benchmark suite, and/or the suite website will contain more useful data and
visualizations.

**Desirable skills**

Basic knowledge of Rust, intermediate knowledge of frontend web technologies (TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Vue).

**Project size**

Medium.

**Difficulty**

Medium.

### Improve bootstrap

**Description**

The Rust compiler it bootstrapped using a complex set of scripts and programs generally called just `bootstrap`.
This tooling is constantly changing, and it has accrued a lot of technical debt. It could be improved in many areas, for example:

- Design a new testing infrastructure and write more tests.
- Write documentation.
- Remove unnecessary hacks.

**Expected result**

The `bootstrap` tooling will have less technical debt, more tests, and better documentation.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Knowledge of the Rust compiler bootstrap process is welcome, but not required.

**Project size**

Medium or large.

**Difficulty**

Medium.

### Improve infrastructure automation tools

**Description**

Rust infrastructure uses many custom tools designed for automating pull request merging, handling discussions on Zulip,
managing GitHub permissions etc. It would be a great help to Rust maintainers if these tools were improved. Here are a
few possible tasks that could be implemented:

- Complete the implementation of [bors](https://github.com/rust-lang/bors), our new implementation of a merge queue
bot for GitHub. It currently lacks support for performing merges (it can only perform so-called "try builds").
- Add support for interacting with the Rust team calendar through Zulip, using e.g. some kind of GitHub app bot.
- Add support for creating Zulip streams using the [Rust team data](https://github.com/rust-lang/team) repository.
- Implement a GitHub app for [sync-team](https://github.com/rust-lang/sync-team), our tool for managing permissions of Rust maintainers.

**Expected result**

Rust infrastructure management tools will receive new features, better documentation and tests.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Familiarity with GitHub APIs is a bonus.

**Project size**

Medium.

### Rewrite the Rust compiler's integration tests in Rust

**Description**

The Rust compiler currently uses a so-called `run-make` test suite for complex test scenarios that involve other tools (e.g. bash utilities, linkers, etc.) in addition to the compiler itself. As the name suggests, these tests are based on `make`, and they invoke various tools to test complex situations.

However, this approach has a number of drawbacks:

- Because the tests are based on commandline tools like `nm` and `grep`, test authors and reviewers have to know the syntax of these tools, which can be quite arcane and is often interleaved with Makefile's own syntax.
- Tests are hard to read because they are based on commandline tool exit codes.
- It is quite hard to write these tests in a cross-platform way, since each implementation often behaves slightly differently. This leads to various issues and workarounds, especially on non-Unix platforms.
- In many cases, when a test fails, it is quite hard to find where exactly it failed.
- It is quite easy to write a test that looks fine, but actually does not test anything (e.g. testing that certain text is not present in the output passes because a program silently fails to produce any output).

The goal of this project is to replace these Makefile tests with a new test harness, where the tests would be written using regular Rust code. To support these tests, a support library should be implemented, which will be used by the tests to perform common actions, such as invoking the compiler, grepping files, checking symbols, finding tools, and providing readable error messages when a test fails. The support library can rely on commandline tools under the hood, but it should provide a nice Rust API that behaves the same on all platforms. The tests can be ported to the new framework one at a time, and the old Makefile framework can be removed once all tests are ported.

There is currently already an open [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113026) that has initiated some of what is
described here, however there is still a lot of follow-up work left to be done.

**Expected result**

`run-make` tests are replaced with an ergonomic and well-documented Rust-based test infrastructure. A fraction of the old
`run-make` tests are ported to the new Rust-based test infrastructure.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust.

Familiarity with standard bash utilities and their behavior preferred (e.g. `grep`, `nm` and others).

Medium or large.

## Cargo

### Move cargo shell completions to Rust

**Description**

Cargo maintains Bash and Zsh completions, but they are duplicated and limited in features.
We want to implement completions in Cargo itself, so we can have a single implementation with per-shell skins ([rust-lang/cargo#6645](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6645)).
Most of the implementation will be in clap ([clap-rs/clap#3166](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3166)), allowing many tools to benefit from this improvement.

**Expected result**

Cargo shell completion will be extended and implemented in Rust.
This will allow access to easier to add new commands / arguments to commands, richer results, and easier testing.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Shell familiarity is a bonus.

### Implement workspace publish in Cargo

**Description**

Today, developers can group Rust packages into a workspace to make it easier to operate on all of them at once.
However, `cargo package` and `cargo publish` do not support operating on workspaces ([rust-lang/cargo#1169](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1169)).

The goal of this project is to modify the Cargo build tool to add support for packaging and publishing Cargo workspaces.

**Expected result**

Milestone 1: `cargo package` can be run, with verification, with the standard package selection flags
Milestone 2: `cargo publish` can do the same as above, but also serially post the `.crate` files to the registry when done,
reporting to the user what was posted/failed if interrupted.

## Rustfmt

### Improve rustfmt infrastructure and automation

**Description**

Rustfmt is the code formatter for Rust code. Currently, to ensure stability, rustfmt uses unit tests that ensure a source file do not get reformatted unexpectedly. Additionally, there is a tool (currently a shell script) called [`diffcheck`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/ci/check_diff.sh#L187-L216) that gets run to check potentially unexpected changes across different large codebases. We would like to improve our tooling around that, namely improving the diffcheck job to include more crates, improve reporting (with HTML output, like a mini [crater](https://crater-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/pr-114776-1/index.html), which runs compiler changes against all Rust crates published to crates.io), potentially rewriting the job in Rust, and reliability.

Rustfmt currently has a versioning system that gates unstable changes behind `Version=Two`, and the diffcheck job may be less reliable to report changes to `Version=One` when changes to unstable formatting are introduced. We'd like to see this story improved to make our test system more robust.

**Expected result**

A more robust and reliable infrastructure for testing the rustfmt codebase, potentially rewritten in Rust, with HTML output.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Knowledge of CI and automation welcomed.

**Project size**

Small or medium, depending on the scale proposed.

**Difficulty**

Small or medium.

### Improve handling of silent failures in rustfmt

**Description**

The internal formatting mechanisms in rustfmt has issues tracking the context when issues occur when applying formatting. This can lead to silent failures and limit the ability for rustfmt to retry formatting. A potential solution would be to refactor the [`Rewrite`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustfmt_nightly/rewrite/trait.Rewrite.html) trait, currently used to format various AST structures, which could improve how we handle situations where it failed to format.

More details in the discussions linked below.

**Expected result**

Improved user experience with less silent failures (provide context as to how and why formatting failed) and allowing rustfmt to retry formatting under more contexts.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Understanding of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structures are welcomed, but not required.

## Crate ecosystem

### Modernize the libc crate

**Description**

The [libc](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc) crate is one of the oldest crates of the Rust ecosystem, long predating
Rust 1.0. Additionally, it is one of the most widely used crates in the ecosystem (#4 most downloaded on crates.io).
This combinations means that the current version of the libc crate (`v0.2`) is very conservative with breaking changes and
remains backwards-compatible with all Rust compilers since Rust 1.13 (released in 2016).

The language has evolved a lot since Rust 1.13, and we would like to make use of these features in libc. The main one is
support for `union` types to proper expose C unions.

At the same time there, is a backlog of desired breaking changes tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/issues/3248). Some of these come from
the evolution of the underlying platforms, some come from a desire to use newer language features, while others are
simple mistakes that we cannot correct without breaking existing code.

The goal of this project is to prepare and release the next major version of the libc crate.

**Expected result**

The libc crate is cleaned up and modernized, and released as version 0.3.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust.

Medium.

### Allow customizing lint levels and reporting in `cargo-semver-checks`

**Description**

[`cargo-semver-checks`](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks) is a linter for semantic versioning. It ensures
that Rust crates adhere to semantic versioning by looking for breaking changes in APIs.

Currently, semver lints have a hardcoded level (e.g. breaking changes are "major") and are always reported at a "deny"
level: if the release being scanned is a minor version bump, any lints at "major" level are reported as errors.

This can be insufficient for some projects, which may desire to:
- configure some lints to have a different level ‚Äî e.g. turn a semver "major" lint into a "minor" lint, or vice versa
- turn some lints into warnings instead of hard errorrs ‚Äî reporting level "warn" instead of the default "deny"
- disable some lints altogether by setting their reporting to "allow"
- (stretch goal) allow customizing lint levels and reporting on a per-module basis

Having such functionality would allow `cargo-semver-checks` to ship additional lints that target changes whose semver
implications are defined by project maintainers on a per-project basis. An example of such a change is bumping the
minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of a project ‚Äî some projects consider it a semver-major change, whereas for
others it is minor or patch.

This functionality would also allow us to write lints similar to clippy's ["suspicious" lint group](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/lints.html#suspicious),
flagging code that is suspect (and deserving of closer scrutiny) but possibly still correct. Such lints should be
opt-in / "warn" tier to avoid annoying users, which is something this project would enable us to do.

**Expected result**

`cargo-semver-checks` lints will be configurable via the [`package.metadata`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-metadata-table) table in `Cargo.toml`
using a clear, simple and expressive way. The design will be suitable for both single-crate projects and workspaces.

### Add more lints to `cargo-semver-checks`

**Description**

[`cargo-semver-checks`](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks) is a linter for semantic versioning. It ensures
that Rust crates adhere to semantic versioning by looking for breaking changes in APIs.

It can currently catch ~60 different kinds of breaking changes, so there are hundreds of kinds of breaking changes it
still cannot catch! The goal of this project is to extend its abilities, so that it can catch and prevent more breaking changes, by:
- adding more lints, which are expressed as queries over a database-like schema ([playground](https://play.predr.ag/rustdoc))
- extending the schema, so more Rust functionality is made available for linting

**Expected result**

`cargo-semver-checks` will contain new lints, together with test cases that both ensure the lint triggers when expected
and does not trigger in situations where it shouldn't (AKA false-positives).

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust. Familiarity with databases, query engines, or query language design is welcome but
not required.

**Project size**

Small or large (depends on how many lints will be implemented).

**Difficulty**

### Implement a cryptographic algorithm in RustCrypto

**Description**

The [RustCrypto Project](https://github.com/RustCrypto) maintains pure Rust implementations of
hundreds of cryptographic algorithms, organized into repositories by algorithm type, e.g.
block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions.

Each of these repositories contains a tracking issue identifying specific algorithms which currently
lack an implementation, some of which are linked in the "Related Links" section below. Interested
students can look through these issues and identify an algorithm which is currently unimplemented
which sounds interesting to them, and then implement it as part of this project.

Alternatively, instead of implementing a new algorithm from scratch, a student could potentially
choose to implement some significant unit of functionality in an existing algorithm implementation
with an open associated issue on our GitHub trackers, an example of which might be
[implementing hardware acceleration support for our "bignum" library](https://github.com/RustCrypto/crypto-bigint/issues/1).

**Expected result**

One or more Rust crates/libraries containing a new implementation of a cryptographic algorithm implemented in pure Rust.

**Desirable skills**

Intermediate knowledge of Rust.

A background in mathematics, and some prior knowledge of cryptography, is helpful but not required,
and we can provide guidance and review to ensure code is correct and securely implemented.

**Project size**

Will vary depending on the algorithm/project selected, but ideally small.

Note that while the code size of the deliverable may not be significant, due to the nature of
cryptographic work it will typically still involve significant effort and iteration to deliver an
implementation which is correct and secure.

**Difficulty**

Will also vary depending on the algorithm/project selected, but expected difficulty is medium/hard, as noted above.
